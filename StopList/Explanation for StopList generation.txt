To generate stop lists, we need to consider the combination of:
1) term frequency of the term
2) document frequency of the term

A combination of higher term frequency along with a higher document frequency indicates
the term to be a part of a stop list.

In our case, we have a corpus of 1000 documents. Thereby, according to me,
the stop list must contain the terms whose term frequency is greater than
5000 and whose document frequency is greater than 675. Only if both these conditions
satisfy, we consider the term to be a part of our stop list.

If a term occurs in more than 67.5% of the documents, along with a high term frequency,
then the term is considered to be a part of the stop list. Hence, for our corpus of 1000
documents, I have considered the document frequency to be greater than 675.

NOTE: PFA "StopList.txt" which shows all the terms considered to be a part of our stop list
      for the given corpus.
